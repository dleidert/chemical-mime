1. About chemical-mime-data
===========================

The chemical-mime-data [1] package is a collection of data [2] files to add
support for various chemical MIME types on Linux/UNIX desktops, such as
KDE [3] and GNOME [4].

Chemical MIMEs [5] have been proposed [6] in 1995, though it seems they have
never been registered with IANA [7]. But they are widely used and the projects
aim is, to support these important, but unofficial MIME types.

Initial data was taken from »The Chemical MIME Home Page« of Henry Rzepa [5],
but this compilation is written and continuously extended by Egon Willighagen,
Daniel Leidert and others (see the distributed AUTHORS [8] file for a list of
who has contributed to this project).

3. Introduction and configuration
=================================

Newer desktop systems need to know the MIME type to associate applications
with it. Writers of chemical applications can, will and make use of this
feature too. But there are several systems [12].

Newer GNOME [4] and ROX [13] desktops use the Shared MIME-info
Database [14][15] to determine MIMEs. We provide a file chemical-mime-data.xml
which has be installed into the 'packages' sub-directory. It follows the
freedesktop.org [16] specification [17]. After running 'update-mime-database'
the chemical MIME types are registered.

To associate an icon for a MIME type, the icon has to be installed into the
hicolor-theme [18] and named e.g.:

    gnome-mime-chemical-x-xyz.png
    gnome-mime-chemical-x-cml.png

The syntax is:

    gnome-<icon-type>-<mime-media-type>-</mime-sub-type>.png

If the icon naming scheme follows this direction, the MIME type is
automatically associated with the icon. This should work for all systems and
applications mentioned under >6. Current Status< [14]. You will need the
shared-mime-info [14] package for your distribution

Older GNOME desktops use the mime-info [14] path with .keys and .mime files to
determine MIME stuff. Icons are installed into the pixmaps directory.

KDE desktops use the mimelnk [14] path with .desktop files to determine MIME
stuff. The .desktop format is now developed by the freedesktop.org
project [16] and specified on [19].

A collection of documents can be found at the projects site [20].


4. Installation
===============

To build and install chemical-mime-data from CVS:

    (1) install autoconf, automake, intltool/gettext, xsltproc
    (2) get the CVS sources
    (3) run autogen.sh (./autogen.sh)
    (4) see next part ...

To build and install chemical-mime-data from release tarballs:

    (1) Get the required applications:
        - intltool/gettext, pkg-config
        - RSVG2 or imagemagick
        - xsltproc
        - gnome-mime-data, shared-mime-info
    
    (2) Configure and compile:
        (see ./configure --help for possible configure options)
          $ ./configure [options-you-like-most-here]
          $ make
       
    (3) Install everything:
          $ su
          # make install
       
($: means user-shell, #: means root-shell)

The file INSTALL [21] contains some generic installation instructions.


5. Associate your chemical application with a chemical MIME type
================================================================

To associate the chemical MIME types with a special application, you need to
do the following:

	* KDE: [19][22][23] ([19] only for KDE 3.3 and above)
	* GNOME [19][24][25][26]

The desktop-file-utils [27] package contains command-line applications to
validate, manipulate and install .desktop files and to update the database,
which holds information about applications and associated MIME types.
