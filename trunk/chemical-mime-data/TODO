# Summary   Things to do before we can do the next release.

TODO 
====

Before next release 0.1
-----------------------

* Extend flat database.

* Fix kde/* directory to fit new flat database.

* Create XSL stylesheet for KDE files and the website.

* Add information about changed requirements to README/INSTALL (xsltproc).

* Only support often used MIME types for the moment (some conflicts seem hard
  to solve) and add related magic stuff to chemical-mime-data.xml.in.

  -> add/change to descriptive comments/names
     (Fix everything in kde/ and gnome/ after coming to a solution for the
      freedesktop.org stuff.)

* Fix GNOME 2.12+ support: see
  http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-vfs-list/2006-January/msg00007.html.

* Fix gnome-mime-data support: see
  http://www.gnome.org/learn/admin-guide/latest/ch05s02.html.


Contributiors TODO
------------------

* Icons

  -> hicolor theme should cover all MIME types
  -> current SVGs are only basic (not really "chemical")
  -> a MIME type chemical/<type> can still get a special icon, which have to
     be named: gnome-mime-chemical-<type>.png.
  -> ROX-filer can't handle generic MIME media type icons (like nautilus does)


Future Releases
---------------

* Add language support for different languages
  currently maintained: de nl fr

* Try to 'script' the building of kde/*.desktop(.in) and
  chemicalmime.{keys|mime}, so we don't need to pay attention to 3 subdirs.

  -> possibly use XML/XSLT and chunks?
  -> how to handle _category field in .keys?
  -> or maybe script the building of all mime support files by making one
     database with all possible values and formats?

* Test for XFCE4.2 support

* Look further for these mime types (not yet included, in alphabetical order):

  x-cdx              *.cdx
  x-ct               *.ct
  x-eye2eye          
  x-msi-molfile      *.msm
  x-mdl-isis         *.skc
  x-mopac-den        
  x-mopac-esp        *.esp, *.ESP
  x-pdb-ribbon       
  x-ppd              
  x-questel-f1       *.f1d
  x-questel-f1-query *.f1q
  x-smd              *.smd
  x-synopsys-accord  *.acc

* Solve conflicts:
  - chemical/x-cerius
  - chemical/x-chemdraw
  - chemical/x-daylight-smiles
  - chemical/x-genbank
