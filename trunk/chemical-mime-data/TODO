# Summary   Things to do before we can do the next release.

TODO 
====

* !!! Fix README and INSTALL (see other project) !!! before we do the official

  currently maintained: de

* How to handle _category field in .keys? Do we need more fields?

Contributiors TODO
------------------

* Icons (especially for contributors - I'm not an artist)

  -> hicolor theme should cover all MIME types
  -> current SVGs are only basic (not really "chemical")
  -> a MIME type chemical/<type> can still get a special icon, which have to
     be named: gnome-mime-chemical-<type>.png.
  -> ROX-filer can't handle generic MIME media type icons (like nautilus does)
  -> possible move the KDE qc icon from viewmol to this package?
