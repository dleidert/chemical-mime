# Summary   Things to do before we can do the next release.

TODO 
====

- replace cm:icon by generic-icon
- conflicting glob pattern must get a weight
- new elements for file magic database


* SERIOUS: the pattern check fails if a a MIME type conflicts with at least 2
           other types in the external database!

* Before 0.2.0 release

  + Fix INSTALL.

  + Add a stylesheet to create .desktop files for applications (install this
    stylesheet? - would need the database too - Idea: Associate the stylesheet
    directly with the source and upload the necessary files to sf.net).

* Later branches

  + Test for XFCE4.2 support.

  + The "Chemical MIME Connection" lists MIME types per application. Our
    database contains the necessary information to update this information.


* General

  + Add language support for different languages

  + Add more MIME-types to our database.
  
  + Add more "magic" to our database and solve conflicts for:
    - chemical/x-cerius
    - chemical/x-chemdraw
    - chemical/x-daylight-smiles
    - chemical/x-genbank (maybe solved)
    - chemical/x-mif
    
  + Look further for these mime types (not yet included, in alphabetical
    order):
    
    x-ct               *.ct
    x-eye2eye          
    x-msi-molfile      *.msm
    x-mdl-isis         *.skc
    x-mopac-den        
    x-mopac-esp        *.esp, *.ESP
    x-pdb-ribbon       
    x-ppd              
    x-questel-f1       *.f1d
    x-questel-f1-query *.f1q
    x-smd              *.smd
    x-synopsys-accord  *.acc
    
    from /usr/share/doc/gdis/gdis_manual.txt.gz
    fdf the free data format, suitable for the SIESTA package (.fdf)
    marvin output (.mvnout, .mvout)
    gdis morphology file (.gmf)
    gulp input (.gin), restart (.res), and ouput (.got) (gulp also used by viewmol!)
    xtl (.xtl) (gulp added but not activated)
    'ACC', "chemical/x-synopsys-accord" Accord ActiveX Chemistry Control
    Questel DARC-F1
    NBRF/PIR http://www.psc.edu/general/software/packages/seq-intro/nbrffile.html
    chemixal/x-mpsa http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/screenpdf/16/3/286.pdf
    cclib has built-in rules to determine computational chemistry packages file types

    viewmol also uses: x-turbomole*

  + Add Icons (especially for contributors - I'm not an artist)
    !!! basic support has been removed in 0.1.95 because of icons missing !!!
    - hicolor theme should cover all MIME types
    - current SVGs are only basic (not really "chemical")
    - a MIME type chemical/<type> can still get a special icon, which have to
      be named: gnome-mime-chemical-<type>.png.
    - ROX-filer can't handle generic MIME media type icons (like nautilus does)
    - possible move the KDE qc icon from viewmol to this package?

  + Add tests:
    - kmimetypefinder (testing KDE4)

  + Check, if we should better use xsl:key to pre-select supported elements:

    <xsl:key name="supported" match="fdo:mime-type" use="@cm:support"/>

    <xsl:apply-templates
         select="key('gnome_supported', 'yes')[child::fdo:glob[not(cm:conflicts[attribute::gnome = 'yes'])]]">
      <xsl:sort select="@type"/>
    </xsl:apply-templates>
